# AAS WorldWide Telescope Research Kit

This repository contains the code for the [AAS] [WorldWide Telescope][wwt-home]
(WWT) research user interface, and supporting systems. Learn more about WWT
[here][wwt-home].

## Developers’ quick start

1. Check out this repository to a machine with [Node.js] and [npm].
1. `git submodule update --init`
1. `npx lerna bootstrap`
1. `npm run build` creates:

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/en/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

This repository is a [monorepo] containing the source for several interlocking
TypeScript packages. README files inside the individual subdirectories give more
information about their contents and development workflows. The multi-package
structure of this repository is dealt with using [Lerna].

[Lerna]: https://lerna.js.org/

Running NPM command from inside package subdirectories unfortunately *will not*
work due to the centralized `node_modules` directory we use with Lerna. To run
the `lint` command only for the `research-app` submodule, run:

```
npx lerna run --scope @wwtelescope/research-app lint
```

(The `--scope` argument can be a glob expression if you want to run on a subset
of packages.)


## Continuous Integration and Deployment

This repository uses [Cranko] to automate release workflows. This automation is
essential to the smooth and reproducible deployment of the WWT web services.

## Getting involved

We love it when people get involved in the WWT community! You can get started
by [participating in our user forum] or by
[signing up for our low-traffic newsletter]. If you would like to help make
WWT better, our [Contributor Hub] aims to be your one-stop shop for
information about how to contribute to the project, with the
[Contributors’ Guide] being the first thing you should read. Here on GitHub we
operate with a standard [fork-and-pull] model.
