## Requirements

* JupyterLab >= 2.0


## Installation

In principle, all you need to do is:

```bash
$ jupyter labextension install @wwtelescope/jupyterlab
```

There is a `jupyter labextension uninstall` command to remove the extension


## Development

Some useful commands are as follows:

```bash
$ jupyter labextension install .  # link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
$ jupyter lab build  # Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
$ jlpm watch  # Auto-rebuild sources (long-running)
$ jupyter lab --watch  # Run JupyterLab, auto-reloading changed extensions (long-running)
```
