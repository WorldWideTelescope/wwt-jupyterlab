# @wwtelescope/jupyterlab 1.0.0 (2021-02-09)

Initial release of the AAS WorldWide Telescope JupyterLab extension. This
extension bridges the WWT "research app", its HTML interface aimed at research
uses, and the JupyterLab environment, such that you can open up the research app
in JupyterLab and talk to it through running kernels.

Documentation and more infrastructure to come, but this release should be
functional.
