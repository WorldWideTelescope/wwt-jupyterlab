# rc: force 1.2.0

This package provides the new "prebuilt" version of the [@wwtelescope/jupyterlab]
JupyterLab extension. Compared to the previous release of the extension, changes
are:

[@wwtelescope/jupyterlab]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wwtelescope/jupyterlab

- Make the app URL configurable using JupyterLab's settings framework (#7,
  @pkgw). The setting is `@wwtelescope/jupyterlab:research/appUrl`.
- Improve the package metadata, such as `jupyerlab/discovery` records in
  the `package.json` file (#7, @pkgw).
